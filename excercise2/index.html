<h2>The Perception of a Monster</h2>
<p>It has often been argued that the definition of a monster is something inhuman, something or someone who has no regard for life and nature and that which is good. Many times in literature the word monster is used to refer to men who have done horrible things: rape, murder, mass genocide. The weight that this word carries is many times undermined by things such as Halloween costumes or children’s cartoon characters.</p><p>The only reason that the being is first associated with the term monster is due to his appearance, because “his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries…his hair was of a lustrous black…his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes…his shriveled complexion and straight black lips” (Shelley 60). Society judges Frankenstein’s creation before it even has time to show its true nature.</p>
<h2>The Frankenstein Complex</h2>
<p>The Frankenstein Complex was born out of such harsh judgments against beings of the unknown. The Frankenstein Complex is the “fear of artificial human beings”(Clapper). But in reality, the Frankenstein Complex should be a fear of creators. Victor should be considered the monster. Victor expresses characteristics of what makes a monster. He is “unnatural” in his obsession to create life and his close relationships with others. Victor is “hostile” toward his creation the moment it is “born,” yet the creature has yet to earn such hatred. Victor is the one that has no compassion for others; he turns his back one a creature who needs him; “[Victor] was the one responsible for William’s murder,” and the rest of his family ( Soyka). Society is wrong in placing its fear on creations that are unnatural; they should place their fear where it is due, on the creator.</p>

<h2>Victor is the monster</h2>
<p>Victor is the monster in this horror novel by Mary Shelley, because he possesses many of the characteristics that define what a monster is. Victor Frankenstein created his being due to his thirst for alchemy and his unnatural obsession with being like God, for Victor believes that “a new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. I might in process of time… renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption” (Shelley 52).

Victor does not take into account the consequences of his actions. Victor rejects his creation the moment he lays eyes on its animated form. This cruel rejection is what sparks the beginning of a journey that will ultimately end in the death of Victor. Victor devalued his creation’s life for personal gain, which led inevitably to his own great personal suffering and the suffering of those close to him.</p>
<h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
<p>When Victor destroys his Creatures companion, the Creature has reached his breaking point. Never knowing a kind gesture, act, or friendship would make anyone reacted in a way that the Creature did. The Creature promised Victor that “I shall be with you on your wedding-night (Shelley 147). Though the Creature gives Victor this warning, Victor still marries Elizabeth, but loses her to the Creature’s need for revenge. Victor stole from the Creature his only hope at companionship, therefore the Creature stole Victor’s only love. Victor finally decides to take action against his Creature, yet this race for revenge that the creator and creation engage in only strengthens the point that the Creature is not a monster. Even at his worst, the Creature cannot bring himself to see Victor suffer over much, and at Victor’s deathbed, the Creature weeps because there is not any peace or triumph to be found.</p>
<h3>The creature vs. Dr. Frankenstein</h3>
<h4><strong><em>The creature</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The only reason that the creature is first associated with the term monster is due to his appearance.</li>
<li>Because of his look, people judge him before he even gets to show his true nature.</li>
<li>the creature was a product of a scientific experiment , who had a torturous and solitude life because his creator, Victor Frankenstein.</li>
 <li> People would attack him and push him away because they were horrified of what they were seeing, without even giving him a chance to speak up.</li>
 <li>He had all the characteristics of a normal human being, but because of his appearance he could never be accepted by the society.</li>
 </ul>
 <h4><strong><em>Dr. Frankenstein</em></strong></h4>
 <ul>
 <li>Victor Frankenstein is mostly responsible for all of the creature’s actions because he was the creator.</li>
 <li>When Victor Frankenstein decided to create a life, or bring dead back to life, he must have been held responsible and ready to face the consequences of his creation.</li>
 <li>Victor was the one that used dead peoples body parts and pieced them together to create this creature.</li>
 <li>When life came into a human body, Victor was so terrified of his own creation’s appearance, that he ran way from it, something that only the worst of parents would do. </li>
 <li>Because of Victor’s selfish act, William, his younger brother, got murdered, and even by knowing that his creation murdered William, he still refused to speak up, which would have spared Justine’s life.</li>
 </ul>
 <h5>To conclude...</h5>
 <p>the creature was a product of a scientific experiment , who had a torturous and solitude life because his creator, Victor Frankenstein. He had all the characteristics of a normal human being, but because of his appearance he could never be accepted by the society.</p><p>Because of Victor Frankenstein’s selfishness, he ruined his brother’s life, people who were close to him. He accomplished his goal as a scientist, but as a normal person he failed miserably. He brought the dead back to life by his own choice, but he never tried to help and guide him.</p>
